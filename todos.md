# Status of the project

## Completed: 

 1.  SumMe GT scores for the F1 reduction 
 2. Notebook for experimenting with Training
 3. Notebook for visualising differences between predictions and ground truth
 4. The four scenarios for the post-processing. 

 ## TODO:

 - [ ] Run a training simulation where each of the scenarios for model selection is employed, do it in one training iteration in order to save time. 
 - [ ] For the model results over the different baselines you've obtained for the representation learning project, Showcase the variance of the predictions and their scores pre-ranking versus the ground truth in TVSUM and SumME. Plot the results of the best correlation and worst correlation. 

 - [ ] Rerun each of these baselines with the Canonical, Augmented and Transfer Setting.

 - [ ] Experiment with Different ground truths for the SumMe datasets to see what may perform better:
    - [ ] Ratio of Included vs Excluded per frame
    - [ ] Weighted average with greater weight assigned to inclusions.
    - [ ] Most Votes
